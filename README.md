# Method of Prediction

This project presents a machine learning approach to predict a target variable based on a set of features using multiple models and evaluation techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using Python-based tools.

## üìÇ Contents

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and others)
- Model evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Normalize/standardize features

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Use correlation matrices or feature importance from models

3. **Modeling**
   - Train various models such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Random Forest
     - XGBoost
   - Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV

4. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluate models using:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision, Recall, F1-score
     - ROC-AUC
   - Plot confusion matrices and ROC curves

5. **Comparison**
   - Compare models based on evaluation metrics and select the best-performing model.

## üìà Results

- The best model achieved high accuracy and good generalization on unseen data.
- Insights into feature importance and model behavior were visualized.
